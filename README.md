This is a poem about Rainbows and Teddy Bears
Red
Orange
Yellow

and a cute little Teddy Bear
and a very ugly little Teddy Bear :(
The ugly Teddy Bear was sadly looked down upon by the cute Teddy Bear
But the first Teddy Bear held his head high and proclaimed he was not ugly
so the first Teddy Bear ended up being more cute after all 

and the previously cute Teddy Bear became sad
